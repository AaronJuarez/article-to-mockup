You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Since I started the Nanodegree before this new changes and the extra projects added, I guess that this new modules are kind of a review.It's been quite easy but there is always something new that you can learn, for example I didn't new abour the Markdown syntax, that's very usefull. I also hadn't used the figure or the figcaption tabs.

The way I've used the strategies is that I study at different places, I can focus that well If a stay at home. I also google any doubts I have, there is a lot of help over the internet.
